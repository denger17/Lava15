what are Variable?
   Variables are conteiners or boxes in the memory that can hold teh data for us.
 Why we need Variables:
   Before we can ask the computer to do something for us we need to store the information and instructions
   in a file then we feed those to the computer and computer does that ting for us.

 How to create the variables(syntax):
   1) We need to tell the computer what type of box/container/variable we neeb
   2) We need to give a name to the box.
