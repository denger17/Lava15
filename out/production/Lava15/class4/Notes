Operators:
    Operators are diferent symbols we can use to perform operations like addition, substractions we can compare things if two
    entities are same or not if a number is gheater than the other number or not .
    There are three main types of operators. They are Arithmetics operators, Relational operators andlogical
    operators.

Arithmetic operators:
    We use Arithmetic operators to perform simple math operations. Like additions, substraction etc.
    + => Addition
    - => substraction
    / => Division
    * => multiplication
    % => moduls , remainder

Relational operators:
    Relational operators are used to compare two quantities or entities. for example if something is bigger than other thing or if two
    number are same or not or if two boolean variables contain same value or not.
    == => used to check if two variables contain the same value or not if same we get true otherwise we get false.
    != => used to check if two variables don't contain the same value. we get a true if they are not same.
    >  => used to check if one value is greather than other value or not if greater we get a true
    <  => used to check if value on the left is smaller than the value on right side we will get a true.
    >= => if the value on left is greater than the value on right side or if they are same we will get a true
    <= => it oposite of >= and it used to check if something is less than or equal to other thing

Conditional constructs:
    Used to write conditional code. a piece of code that execute based on a condition if condition is true that java execute
    the code otherwise it skip that code.
    How to write Ifelse conditions:
    if (condition){
    any line of code even another if condition

    if(){
    }

    }
    Important notes:
    1)for String we use equals method instead of === sign because it s a non-primitive data type
    2) We can cmd+opt+l(mac) ctrl+alt+l (Windows) to format our code.
    3) if we are confused about brackets we can click on opening or closing part to check the other part.

    If else conditions
    when we have to test the same variable for multiple conditions i should use if else if
    when we have multiple conditions and these conditions are dependt on each other Nested if conditions
